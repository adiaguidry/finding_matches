<h1>Finding Matches</h1> 
This is a game of concentration. You flip cards over in attempts to match them, remember where you saw it last is key to winning the game. The longer you take and the more cards you flip over that are not matches gets Bruce angry! We do not want to see Bruce angry! 

This was my first project that I completed. I used HTML, CSS, JS, and JQUERY.
